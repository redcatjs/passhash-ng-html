# Password Hasher NG HTML
html version based on [Password Hasher NG Firefox extension](https://github.com/phreaknerd/passhash-ng)

See [demo](https://redcatjs.github.io/passhash-ng-html/)


## What does it do?
The hasher is generating a unique password for every site you visit. 
This works simply by creating a so called hash from the site-tag and your master-key. 

Bam. Different passwords for every site. You only have to remember your master-key which is never stored anywhere.

## Installing npm/gulp dependencies
Get npm here: https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm
In project root:
$> npm install

## Compiling dist/index.html
In project root
$> gulp
Now you have a standalone dist/index.html which can easily be shared or used on a mobilephone.
